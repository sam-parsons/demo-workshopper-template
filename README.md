demo-workshopper-template
================

This repo was based upon [Lin Clark's demo-workshopper](https://github.com/linclark/demo-workshopper), I have adapted it to use the dev-friendly `workshopper-adventure` and `workshopper-exercise` modules, added a testing framework, and made it accessible as a template.

See [Lin's excellent guide](https://github.com/linclark/lin-clark.com/blob/master/content/blog/2014/07/01/authoring-nodejs-workshopper-lessons.md) for creating your own workshopper lesson.
